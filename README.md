Hello, visitor to my Github repository! My name is Christian Schmidt - I am a physics undergraduate student studying heavy ion collisions at the University of Houston.

There is no general structure to this repository, but I am using it as a casual "portfolio" of some of the codes that I use on a daily basis to analyze data from Trajectum, a hydrodynamic model for heavy ion collisions. I am using it to simulate the conditions of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab.

You will also see some PowerPoint presentations in this repository. I have presented these at various conventions (it should specify which convention on the presentation title slide) to showcase my work with Trajectum and in the nuclear physics field.

Thanks for visiting! If you have any questions about anything in this repository, feel free to contact me at cjschmi3@cougarnet.uh.edu.
